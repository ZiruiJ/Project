This is a repository for Babson 2018 Fall MIS3640 final project.

Team Member: Zirui Jiao, Iris Li

The Big Idea: The main idea of the project is to develop a product that beat their phone addiction and manage their time in an efficient and pleasant way. We want students, officers and any group of people that procrastinate their work to eliminate time-wasting on the distracting websites. It is very similar to the popular app “forest”, however, we want to establish our project on the website. The project wishes to achieve the goal of both blocking the websites and keeping track of working time. We will explore topics such as time countdown, website blocking, the database for users, data interpretation and demonstration. The minimum viable product will be a local program in python that combines website blocking and a timer. The stretch goal would be building the project on a website, generate users’ weekly productivity, connecting friends on the website and encouraging competition in the social group. 

Learning Goal: The learning goals will be implementing an agile development process, researching code computation, seeking help from professionals and developing more python skills beyond the classroom. Also, we want to use this project as an opportunity to explore how computation can be applied to a real-world problem and make a positive influence on people’s productivity. We may also learn to arrange time effectively, finish tasks on time, corporate within the group, and develop interests further. 

The code uses package 'Tkinter'
